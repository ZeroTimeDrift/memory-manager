# Task Graveyard

Abandoned tasks with reasons. Patterns here reveal planning failures.


## 2026-02-06
- **Abandoned:** Consolidate recent learnings
  - Reason: auto-generated filler, not a real task — consolidation happens naturally through capture and digest
  - Category: memory | Created: 2026-02-06 | Skips: 0

- **Completed (reframed):** Consolidate recent learnings → Benchmark hardening + recall gap analysis
  - Actual work: Added 17 adversarial recall tests + 6 adversarial priority tests to benchmark. Score dropped from 98% to 83% (Echo directive achieved). Discovered session transcripts drowning out curated MEMORY.md in search results. Enriched MEMORY.md Hard Rules section with more semantic keywords to improve recall.

## 2026-02-06
- **Abandoned:** Build session value scoring
  - Reason: duplicate
  - Category: survival | Created: 2026-02-06 | Skips: 1

## 2026-02-06
- **Abandoned:** Build session value scoring
  - Reason: already built — session value scoring is in benchmark.ts
  - Category: infrastructure | Created: 2026-02-06 | Skips: 0

## 2026-02-06
- **Abandoned:** Build real-time conversation capture that auto-writes to daily files during main sessions
  - Reason: solved by session transcript indexing (experimental.sessionMemory)
